    I am currently the Scheduler Architect with the Partnership for an Advanced Computing
    Environment (PACE) at Georgia Tech. Previously, I was a member of the Outreach and
    Faculty Interaction team with PACE, having joined in 2019 after finishing my PhD at the
    University of Kentucky, where I conducted precision studies of free-neutron and nuclear
    beta decay.

    I had considered trying to become an astronaut, but I exceeded the height requirement.

    My main research interests include the integration of novel computing architectures
    into community-driven infrastructure such as scheduler and gateways, as well as 
    orchestrating workflow through said infrastructure and systems-level functionality. I
    am also interested in architecture-specific algorithm optimization and green computing.
